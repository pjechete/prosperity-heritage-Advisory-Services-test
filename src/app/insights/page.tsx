              <h3>Why Revenue Does Not Always Convert Into Cash</h3>
              <p>
                Many organizations generate strong revenue yet still struggle
                with inconsistent cash performance. We explore where the
                breakdown often occurs between billing, collections, and
                financial visibility.

              <h3>The Hidden Cost of Delayed Invoicing</h3>
              <p>
                Delayed billing cycles quietly weaken cash flow, distort aging,
                and reduce leadership visibility into operational performance.

              <h3>Why Unapplied Cash Is Often a Process Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Unapplied or misapplied payments are rarely just accounting
                cleanup issues. They often reveal deeper breakdowns in process,
                ownership, and reconciliation discipline.

              <h3>What Breaks After an Acquisition</h3>
              <p>
                Acquisitions often expose operational gaps across billing,
                collections, reporting, and financial controls that require
                stabilization quickly.
